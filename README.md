gitlab-mr
=========

GitHub has a very nice feature where if you raise a PR with only one commit it autopopulates the inputs from the commit message. This Chrome extension replicates that in GitLab.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Replace the `<GITLAB_URL>` in the manifest.json with your gitlab url
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in a browser, and check the box marked "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the repo directory
4. ???
5. Profit!!
